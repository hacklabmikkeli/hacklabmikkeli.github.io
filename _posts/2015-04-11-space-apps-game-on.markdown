After Data Bootcamp yesterday it was time to begin the  hackathon. First we had some nice keynotes from real space professionals: "*Finland in space 1985-2015*" by Pauli Stigell from [Tekes / Space Finland](http://spacefinland.fi/) and "*Realtime satellite and space weather data for online use*" by Ilkka Sillanpää from [Finnish Meteorology Institute](http://ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/tutkimustoiminta).

Soon the teams began working on great variety of projects. Those ranged from "first aid kit for space flights" to complex statistical analysis of asteroid imaging. Everyone found a team and the overall feeling was enthusiastic. Like a proper hackathon should be.

Of course things won't go without surprises. Our surprise was luckily a pleasant one. Finnish minister of European Affairs and Foreign Trade, Lenita Toivakka visited us.

Work on projects will continue the whole night. Tomorrow we will report about the Hacklab Mikkeli challenge and its winning project.
