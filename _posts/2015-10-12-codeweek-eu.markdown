To celebrate [the Europe Code Week 2015](http://www.codeweek.eu/) Hacklab Mikkeli organized its own event in Mikkeli. Our event was built from bunch of different sub-events. The major event was Internet of Things Hackathon which describes itself with its name. Other events included planning and luckily also starting local [Koodikerho](http://koodikerho.fi/) activity, 3D modelling and printing workshop, [API:Suomi](http://www.apisuomi.fi/) meeting which lead to starting API Meetup community to Mikkeli, and last but not least [Open Finland Challenge](http://openfinlandchallenge.fi/) workshop.

One quite interesting project was presented by locusf (Aleksi Suomalainen) from [Kuopio Hacklab](http://kuopio.hacklab.fi/). He has been working on a project that combines Raspberry Pi with SailfishOS. A SailPi tablet. For more detailed information see his blog article: [Deployment and use of the SailPi tablet as real standalone tablet](https://sailpi.wordpress.com/2015/10/11/deployment-and-use-of-the-sailpi-tablet-as-real-standalone-tablet/)
