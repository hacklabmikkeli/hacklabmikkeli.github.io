We have survived as a registered association for one whole year! One year ago we met and decided to make this thing official - 19 brave hackers signed our charter of foundation. Of course we had began planning the hacklab earlier but after receiving huge support from other Finnish hacklabs at Hacklab Summit Finland 2015 in Tampere we had to make the move. After that we have found a place for our hacklab, renovated it to suit our purposes and after that had fun participating and arranging many wonderful events. 

It was time for cake!

We would like to thank all those wonderful people, companies and institutions who have supported us during our first year!
