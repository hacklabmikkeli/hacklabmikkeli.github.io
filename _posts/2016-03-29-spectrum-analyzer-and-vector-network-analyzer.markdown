Hacklab Mikkeli has bought new RF equipment: Rohde & Schwarz FSB 100Hz &mdash;
5GHz spectrum analyzer, and HP 8711B vector network analyzer. They can be
used to measure, for example, frequency, amplitude, spectrum, S/N ratio, THD,
antenna SWR, amplitude response and phase response in a wide frequency range.
The spectrum analyzer can additionally be used as a radio tuner!
Both devices are available to subscribers, and require training to operate.
