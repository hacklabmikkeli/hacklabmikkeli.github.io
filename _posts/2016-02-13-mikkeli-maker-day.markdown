We were invited to plan and execute a small event at local library. Something that involves different examples from our hacklab projects. Something that could make people from junior to senior happy. Something that we can handle with our resources. We would also need a nice name for the event... mmh... this was the most difficult part. Eventually someone screamed out something like Mikkeli Maker Day. Close enough.

The plan was simple: let's gather our things and carry them there. First on display was an arcade cabinet (12 mm mdf, Retropie, some used parts, some new parts):

Of course we had to bring our tweeting cactus, Teuvo (he is @TeuvoHacklabMLI):

...and Seppo, the clever robot seen at HSF'16:
