First course to begin our year 2016 was 3D modelling basics with [Blender](http://www.blender.org/). We asked what courses our community was interested in and 3D modelling basics was voted to first place. Luckily we have some talented Blender users in our members who also volunteered to lead the course.

Earlier our courses have been about eletronics and robotics, so now we needed a whole different layout of tables and seating. Course material and instructing was also designed to suit the skills of participating people which varied from beginner to advanced. These facts made the course a test in many ways.

Everything went fine. Even better than expected. Many of participants found 3D modelling interesting and want to learn more. Easily worth the early wakeup on Saturday morning.
